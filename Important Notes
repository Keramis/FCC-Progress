> :hover is a pseudo-class selector. For example, if you want an effect
  when you hover over a link (anchor, or <a>), you could use:
  a:hover {something}
> (position: relative;) is very useful when wanting to position items.
  the code treats it as if it's still in it's default position, so other
  elements will behave the same. You can move the element with position
  relative with (left, right, top, and bottom). Example:
    p {position: relative; bottom: 10px;}
> (position: absolute;) locks the element in place relative to its parent
  container. !!IMPORTANT. For the parent container, make a (position) CSS
  (often with position: relative) or the browser will keep looking up the
  chain and end up with the <body> element to tag it to.
> (position: fixed;) locks the element in place relative to the entire
  browser window. !! This means it won't move, even if you scroll!
  (Navigation bar) Other elements won't realize it's there, so it 
  WILL overlap with others, since it doesn't exist for them.
