> Box shadow, some are optional options. Look it up.
> :hover is a pseudo-class selector. For example, if you want an effect
  when you hover over a link (anchor, or <a>), you could use:
  a:hover {something}
> (position: relative;) is very useful when wanting to position items.
  the code treats it as if it's still in it's default position, so other
  elements will behave the same. You can move the element with position
  relative with (left, right, top, and bottom). Example:
    p {position: relative; bottom: 10px;}
> (position: absolute;) locks the element in place relative to its parent
  container. !!IMPORTANT. For the parent container, make a (position) CSS
  (often with position: relative) or the browser will keep looking up the
  chain and end up with the <body> element to tag it to.
